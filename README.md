# SudokuSolver
This is a Python project that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It provides a simple and efficient way to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.

# Installation
This project does not require any additional installation. You can simply run the Python script provided in this repository.

# Usage
To use the Sudoku solver, follow these steps:
1. Define your Sudoku puzzle as a 9x9 grid in the if __name__ == "__main__": block. Replace the 0 values with the known values in the puzzle and keep 0 for empty cells.
2. Run the script. It will attempt to solve the Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.
3. If a solution is found, it will be printed to the console. If no solution is possible for the given puzzle, it will print "No solution."

# How It Works
The solver uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the solution. It starts by searching for an empty cell (a cell with the value 0). Once it finds an empty cell, it tries numbers from 1 to 9, checking if each number is a valid choice for that cell. If a number is valid, it is placed in the cell, and the solver continues to the next empty cell. If a valid number cannot be found, the solver backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. This process continues until the entire puzzle is filled or until it is determined that no valid solution exists.
